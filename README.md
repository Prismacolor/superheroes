Creating a data analysis project based on comic book characters.

Please note that this is by no means based on canon and should not be taken seriously, though I am sure it would spark 
some fun and rather interesting debate. This is based on rather simplified information I gleaned from the internet 
regarding these specific characters and their supposed abilities. I attempted to see if there were any clear trends 
regarding things like gender, property (DC or Marvel), abilities, and estimated power levels. 

For the purposes of this project please note that innate abilites are considered powers and abilities inherent in a 
character's body without the use of magic, items, or the need to engage in rituals in order to preserve them. For example,
Thor has innate abilities because he was born on Asgard, but Jane Foster may only have those powers when she picks up Mjolnir, 
so maybe her powers are not immediately accessible, and therefore, are not innate.

Also note that anyone with a nonspecified power level simply means that I was unable (and granted I did not spend a terrible amount
of time on my research, though I certainly could have!) to easily discern where they stood in comparison to everyone else on the list. 
There were definitely clear standouts, for example, most comic book nerds know that Legion and Storm are Omega level, but for 
others, the water was a little murky. It was also tricky because power levels in Marvel are not necessarily defined the same way in 
DC, though I certainly tried. Hence Darkseid being listed as on the same level as Marvel's Onslaught. 

Alas, I was unable to find any clear trends with my data, which could be due to a multitude of factors, like: 

1) Comic book writing is extremely arbitrary and subject to change, and each writer displays powers and abilities differently. 
2) There is no real, clear power scale for either universe. 
3) There is no clear connection between abilities and power (see number 1.) Just because you're a telepath doesn't mean you're Omega.
4) My data was encoded too simply, which resulted in many data points being nearly identical, thus not presenting any clear trends. 
5) Gremlins

Though I did not discover the optimal formula for Beyond Omega Levels of Power (sadface), I had fun and learned a lot of new stuff 
on the way. I got to play with the matplotlib library, learn a little about Kmeans clustering and unsupervised learning, and built 
up my debugging skills. So win! Please feel free to poke around, clone the repo, and see if you can modify it for better results. Or 
read the data and spend endless hours wondering who would win in a battle between Thanos and Apocalypse...Either way, have fun!
